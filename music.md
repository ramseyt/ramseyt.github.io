Recording and playing music have been hobbies of mine for many years.

I’ve engineered literally hundreds of bands in a variety of settings including in-studio multitrack live sets, multitrack studio sessions, and live sound. I’ve also done sound work for films and art installations.

I played in a few bands over the years, most recently [Concord Ballet Orchestra Players](https://cbop.bandcamp.com).

I have an entry at [Discogs](http://www.discogs.com/artist/Ramsey+Tantawi), [Allmusic](http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ramsey-tantawi-mn0001540064), and similar sites but the list of credits at all of them is incomplete. Here's a list of recordings I've done that I know have been released on some sort of physical media, as of the mid-2010's or so which is the last time I really checked.
