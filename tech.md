My first computer was a [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), my current one is a [M2 MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air-13-and-15-m2/), and Iâ€™ve worked in computer and technology-related positions my entire career.

Most recently I worked at Apple for 15 years, working on many different aspects of the software that powers iPhones and iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, Apple TVs, and other hardware. In my latest role there I managed a team of Program Managers and Product Managers in the Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AIML) organization, working with our Speech Recognition (ASR) team as well as working on Siri's accuracy and language coverage. See my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rtantawi) page for more.

I left Apple in February 2023 to reharge and spend more time with my family and especially my young children. As for what's next - stay tuned!
