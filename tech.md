My first computer was a [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), my current one is a [M2 MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air-13-and-15-m2/), and Iâ€™ve worked in computer and technology-related positions my entire career.

I've worked at Apple for 15 years, working on many different aspects of the software that powers iPhones and iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, Apple TVs, and other hardware. I currently manage multiple data programs for Foundation Modeling in the Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AIML) organization. 

Before that I built and managed a team of Program Managers and Product Managers responsible for our Speech Recognition (ASR) technology which powers many Apple products, as well as third party prooducts through on-device API. Going back even further I worked on many software projects for iOS, macOS, and our other platforms.
