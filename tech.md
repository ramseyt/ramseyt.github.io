My first computer was a [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), my current one is a [M2 MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air-13-and-15-m2/), and Iâ€™ve worked in computer and technology-related positions my entire career.

I worked at Apple for 15 years, working on many different aspects of the software that powers iPhones and iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, Apple TVs, and other hardware. In my latest role there I managed a team of Program Managers and Product Managers in the Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AIML) organization, working with our Speech Recognition (ASR) technology and the various products that it powers.

I left Apple in February 2023 to reharge and spend more time with my family and especially my young children. But! I went back in Novemeber 2023 for an opportunity that was too good to pass up. For now see my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rtantawi) page for more career info.

Over the years I've worked on a bunch of personal projects, mostly music and tech. One that I started during my time off I open-sourced as [NotionToHTML](https://github.com/ramseyt/NotionToHTML), a Python library for programatically retrieving content from Notion and converting it to HTML.
